  <h2> Description:</h2><br>
  <p>
     We started by simulating the robot then added a joystick to move the robot and mapped the environment and included the navigation stack and also automated the submap creation and integrated a GUI and voice control. This model uses algorithms for robot navigation based on voice recognition, in this model we use LIDAR sensor to map the layout and g-mapping package will create the map. We have used OpenCv libraries to create sub map for the layout. We have used Ros simulation for this model . We have used Google Speech to Text Api for Voice Recognition. We have add GUI Support to Control the bot and even with joystick you can control it.
